# McDataPack

Conveniences for survival.

- Trident recipe, because drowned farming is boring
- Block generators for items that are non-renewable or renewable only by trading; I don't like devestating landscapes for materials, and trading isn't that fun.
  - Gravel, from gravel and cobblestone
  - Sand, from sand and gravel
  - Blackstone, from basalt and cobblestone
  - Cobbled deepslate, from coal blocks and cobbled deepslate
  - Soul Sand, from sand and bone blocks
  - Soul Soil, from dirt and bone blocks

Given wither skeletons for bones and coal, a cobblestone/basalt generator, and some seed gravel, sand, and dirt, you can renewably generate these materials for building or terraforming.

I added a recipe for string from bamboo because it seemed useful.

Added recycling of mob drops:

- String from bows
- Leather from saddles, leather boots, leggings, chestplates, and helmets
