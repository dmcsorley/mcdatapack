# McDataPack

Conveniences for survival.

- Trident recipe, because drowned farming is boring
- Gravel, Sand, Soul Sand, and Soul Soil recipes, because I don't like devestating landscapes for materials.
  - Gravel can be crafted from gravel and cobblestone
  - Sand can be crafted from sand and gravel
  - Soul Sand can be crafted from sand and bone blocks
  - Soul Soil can be crafted from dirt and bone blocks

Given skeletons (or wither skeletons) for bones, a cobblestone generator, and some seed gravel, sand, and dirt, you can generate enough of any of these materials for terraforming.
